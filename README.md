# dh2000capsule

This repository hosts a handful of files from a digital Time Capsule that I created in my Information Technology class in Grade 12 of Prince Rupert Senior Secondary School.

While the title of the page is *Time Capsule 2000*, this was actually creted in the Spring of 2002 as a "look back" to the year 2000 that could be referenced in the future.

I'm thrilled that I've been able to find this document for sharing as a reflection of what my life was like that many years ago.  Not much has changed :)
